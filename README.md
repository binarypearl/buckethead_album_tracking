Buckethead in a musician that has produced over 122 ~1/2 hour long albums called "Pikes".

They span many genera's, and one Pike could be very fast, the next slow, or anywhere in between.

So the problem I am trying to solve here is, lets say I want to listen to a slower, more chill album.  Which Pikes fall into this category?

While not completed yet, this project uses python, with Django as a web framework.


When I developed Zapper, I created the entire back-end database and code myself by hand.  2 years later, I now realize the power of

web frameworks like Django, because now I just specify the models of what I am trying to do.  So now I don't have to create many of

the back-end details by hand.  This is really cool.


The front-end code is not quite there yet, but basically there is a link to click for each album, and then it pulls the data from the SQLite database.

It then displays the results in a table dynamically, so no page refresh is needed.

The goal here is to create an interface where you can easily run queries so when you are in the mood to listen to particular style, you can easily find

that information and narrow down the Pikes to check out.
